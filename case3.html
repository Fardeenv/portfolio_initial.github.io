    <h1>PageRank for Prioritized <span>Satellite Communication Paths</span></h1>
    <div class="case-section">
      <h3>Introduction</h3>
      <p>
        Imagine a crucial package needs to be delivered across a vast,
        constantly shifting city, but instead of using the fastest, most
        reliable roads, the delivery truck just picks any road. Sometimes it
        gets stuck in traffic, sometimes it takes an unnecessarily long route,
        and sometimes a key bridge fails, causing massive delays. In Starlink's
        network, all satellites are currently treated somewhat equally for
        relaying data, meaning critical "hub" satellites might get overloaded,
        or optimal paths aren't fully utilized. This business case is about
        intelligently
        <strong
          >identifying and prioritizing the most important and reliable
          communication paths in the constellation </strong
        >, like choosing the "superhighways" of space, to ensure data flows
        efficiently and reliably, even if a key link is congested or goes down.

      <h3>Current Scenario</h3>
      <p>
        Starlink uses orbital proximity and signal strength for routing but
        doesn’t account for network centrality. All satellites are treated
        equally for relaying, which can lead to underuse or overuse of certain
        nodes. [Source: MIT Tech Review – Starlink Routing Algorithms Overview,
        2023]

      <h3>Problem</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Critical relay satellites might be underused or overloaded.</li>
        <li>Path choice doesn't consider network centrality.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="case-section">
      <h3>Proposed Optimization</h3>
      <p>
        Use PageRank algorithm to assign importance scores to satellites based
        on their connectivity in the network graph, prioritizing stable,
        high-PageRank satellites for routing. Introduce a redundancy mechanism
        to store primary, secondary, and tertiary central nodes (top three
        PageRank satellites) to mitigate Single point of failure (SPOF) . Apply
        a congestion decay factor to prevent overloading and reroute to backup
        nodes if the primary fails.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="case-section">
      <h3>Why This Algorithm?</h3>
      <p>
        PageRank, effectively measures satellite centrality in directed graphs,
        identifying critical relay nodes. Combined with congestion feedback and
        redundancy, it avoids bottlenecks and ensures fault tolerance, enhancing
        Starlink’s routing reliability.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="case-section">
      <h3>How It’s Optimized</h3>
      <p>
        Prioritizes stable relay paths, avoids bottlenecks, and enhances routing
        resiliency by using secondary/tertiary nodes to prevent single point
        failures
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="case-section">
      <h3>Usage</h3>
      <p>
        If satellite S9 has a high PageRank score, it’s prioritized for routing.
        If S9 is congested or fails, the system falls back to its secondary
        (e.g., S3) or tertiary (e.g., S1) node from the backup list, ensuring
        reliable load distribution.

        data to a PageRank engine, which outputs scores to the routing system. A

          <strong>Time Complexity</strong>: O(V + E), where V is the number of

      <h3>Reflection</h3>
      <p>
        Applying PageRank to prioritize satellite communication paths in
        Starlink’s network was an exciting way to use a well-known algorithm in
        a modern, real-world scenario. The strength of this case lies in
        adapting PageRank, originally designed for web page ranking, to a
        dynamic satellite network. By assigning centrality scores to satellites,
        we ensured critical relay nodes are prioritized, improving routing
        efficiency. Adding a congestion decay factor and backup nodes (secondary
        and tertiary) addressed practical challenges like overloading and single
        point failures, making the solution more resilient. The backup node
        mechanism, stored in a dictionary, was a creative way to enhance fault
        tolerance, ensuring the network remains operational even if a
        high-PageRank satellite fails.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, the solution has limitations that highlight areas for
        improvement. The simulation assumes a static graph with fixed weights,
        ignoring real-time variables like satellite orbital dynamics, varying
        signal strengths, or user demand fluctuations. These assumptions
        simplify the problem but don’t fully capture Starlink’s complex, dynamic
        topology. Before implementation, we’d need to account for these factors,
        such as by integrating real-time telemetry data or recomputing PageRank
        more frequently, which could increase computational costs. Additionally,
        the backup node selection relies solely on Page
