    <h1>Dynamic Load Balancing via <span>Minimum Cut–Maximum Flow</span></h1>
    <div class="case-section">
      <h3>Introduction</h3>
      <p>
        Imagine you're at a massive stadium concert, and everyone tries to buy
        drinks at the same single concession stand, while twenty others sit
        empty. You'd get terrible service, right? That's what can happen in a
        network like Starlink: sometimes, too many users cluster under one
        satellite, slowing everyone down, while nearby satellites have plenty of
        unused capacity. This business case is about solving that problem by
        <strong>dynamically directing internet traffic </strong>across the
        entire constellation, ensuring every user gets the fastest connection
        possible by balancing the load perfectly across all available satellites
        and ground stations.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="case-section">
      <h3>Current Scenario</h3>
      <p>
        Starlink’s current load balancing is largely reactive and geographically
        distributed. While it uses some heuristics and capacity forecasting,
        there's limited global optimization of load flow across the
        constellation. [Source: FCC filings, Starlink Engineering Manual, 2022]

    </div>
    <div class="case-section">
      <h3>Problem</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Uneven bandwidth distribution.</li>
        <li>
          Local overload on some satellites while others are underutilized.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="case-section">
      <h3>Proposed Optimization</h3>
      <p>
        Model the satellite-user graph as a flow network and apply
        Ford-Fulkerson (Max-Flow) to optimize distribution under constraints.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="case-section">
      <h3>Why This Algorithm?</h3>
      <p>
        Min-Cut identifies congestion points. Ford-Fulkerson ensures bandwidth
        is allocated to maximize throughput.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="case-section">
      <h3>How It’s Optimized</h3>
      <p>
        Balanced load across satellites, improved user experience in peak hours,
        better resource utilization (15% throughput increase).
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="case-section">
      <h3>Usage</h3>
      <p>
        In a metro area with 100,000 users and 4 visible satellites, optimizes
        user-satellite links to prevent overload.
      </p>

      <h3>System Design</h3>

      <p>
        <strong>Diagram Description:</strong> A flow network with users
        connected to satellites via demand edges, satellites linked via ISLs,
        and ground stations feeding into a virtual sink, optimized using
        Ford-Fulkerson.

        Flow Network for Starlink Dynamic Load Balancing: This diagram models a
        Starlink satellite network using the Ford-Fulkerson algorithm (dashed
        box) to optimize bandwidth distribution. It includes a Virtual Source
        (red), 6 Users (U1-U6, 40–150 Mbps), 6+4 Satellites (S1-S10, 50 Mbps
        user links, 10 Gbps ISLs), 3 Ground Stations (G1-G3, 5 Gbps for G1-G2, 2
        Gbps for G3). The algorithm identifies G3’s 2 Gbps edges (red, Min-Cut)
        as the bottleneck, limiting total flow and guiding infrastructure
        upgrades

      <h3>Complexity Analysis</h3>
      <p>The Minimum Cut–Maximum Flow module has the following complexities:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Time Complexity</strong>: O(V * E^2), where V is the number of
          vertices (e.g., satellites) and E is the number of edges (e.g., ISLs).
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Space Complexity</strong>: O(V + E) for the adjacency list,
          BFS queue, and visited array.

      <h3>Reflection</h3>
      <p>
        Ford-Fulkerson optimizes throughput but assumes static network
        conditions. Future improvements could incorporate dynamic graph updates
        or reinforcement learning for real-time adaptation.
