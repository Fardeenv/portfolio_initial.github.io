      <h3>Current Scenario (Backed by Real Events)</h3>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>February 2022</strong>: A geomagnetic storm caused by a
          coronal mass ejection (CME) led to the
          <strong>loss of 38 newly launched Starlink satellites</strong> due to
          increased atmospheric drag.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>May 2024</strong>: An extreme geomagnetic storm caused
          <strong>orbital decay and reentry of 12 Starlink satellites</strong>.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>October 2024</strong>: A geomagnetic storm may have
          accelerated the
          <strong>premature reentry of one Starlink satellite (SL-1089)</strong
          >.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Cause</strong>: Solar activity (e.g., solar flares, CMEs)
          heats Earth’s upper atmosphere, increasing
          <strong>atmospheric density</strong> and
          <strong>aerodynamic drag</strong> on low-Earth orbit (LEO) satellites,
          causing altitude loss and reentry.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Challenge</strong>: Starlink relies on preemptive launch
          delays or reactive maneuvers, lacking an
          <strong>AI/algorithm-driven system</strong> for dynamic drag
          forecasting and optimized orbit adjustments.

      <h3>Problem</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Unpredicted drag during solar storms causes satellite loss.</li>
        <li>Reactive maneuvers are inefficient, consuming excessive fuel.</li>
        <li>
          No system integrates spatial drag hotspots, resource constraints, and

      <h3>Proposed Optimization</h3>
      <p>
        Prevent satellite loss by predicting drag-influenced orbital risks using
        ML and identifying high-drag zones with 2D Kadane’s Algorithm. Select
        satellites for maneuvers using an approximate Subset Sum algorithm and
        schedule burns with Stable Marriage, optimizing within fuel and ground
        station constraints.

      <h3>Why These Algorithms?</h3>
      <p>
        2D Kadane’s, efficiently identifies high-drag zones in a spatial grid.
        Subset Sum (approximated via DP) optimizes satellite selection under
        resource constraints.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="case-section">
      <h3>How It’s Optimized</h3>
      <p>
        Predicts drag to preemptively adjust orbits, reducing satellite loss.
        Optimizes fuel by selecting only high-risk satellites and scheduling
        efficient burns, enhancing resilience during geomagnetic storms.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="case-section">
      <h3>Usage</h3>
      <p>
        Before a solar storm, ingest solar activity data (KP index, solar flux)
        to predict drag intensities. Use 2D Kadane’s to locate high-drag zones
        (e.g., polar regions). Apply Subset Sum to select satellites in these
        zones for maneuvers within fuel limits. Use Stable Marriage to assign
        burn windows, ensuring ground station visibility. For example, if 10
        satellites are at risk in a high-drag zone, the system maneuvers only 4
        critical ones, saving fuel.

        <strong>Diagram Description:</strong> Space weather data (KP index,
        solar flux) feeds into the ML-based Drag Forecast Model, which predicts
        atmospheric density. The Heatmap Generator uses 2D Kadane’s to identify
        high-drag zones, visualized as a 2D heatmap with red shading for
        hotspots. Satellite orbital data informs the Subset Sum Planner to
        select satellites for maneuvers, and the Burn Window Matcher (Stable
        Marriage) schedules burns based on ground station visibility.

        Developing this case was a rewarding challenge, combining course
        algorithms with AI to address a pressing issue for Starlink—satellite
        loss during solar storms. The strength of the solution lies in its
        multi-layered approach: 2D Kadane’s efficiently identifies drag
        hotspots, Subset Sum optimizes resource use, and Stable Marriage ensures
        practical scheduling, while ML/LSTM adds predictive power. This mirrors
        the portfolio’s goal of blending theory with real-world applications, as
        seen in Cases 3 (PageRank) and 5 (Stable Marriage). However, limitations
        include the computational complexity of Subset Sum for large satellite
        fleets and the reliance on accurate solar data, which can be noisy. I
        learned how to integrate disparate algorithms into a cohesive system and
        the importance of approximating NP-complete problems like Subset Sum for
        practicality. Future improvements could involve parallelizing 2D
        Kadane’s for global grids or using reinforcement learning for dynamic
        orbit planning, as in Case 8. This case reinforced my ability to apply
        algorithmic thinking to complex networking challenges, preparing me for
        future work in space technology.
